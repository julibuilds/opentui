# Phase 1 Complete: Foundation Infrastructure ✅

## Summary

Successfully completed Phase 1 of the unified rope migration - all foundation infrastructure is in place and tested.

## What We Built

### 1. Segment Type (`text-buffer-segment.zig`)

- Union type combining `text: TextChunk` and `brk: void` (line break marker)
- Complete API: measure(), empty(), is_empty(), getBytes(), asText(), isBreak(), isText()
- Break-aware metrics aggregation with complex boundary logic
- **170 lines** of implementation

### 2. Aggregated Metrics System

Metrics computed at every rope node:

- `total_width`: Sum of all text widths (excludes breaks)
- `break_count`: Number of line breaks in subtree
- `first_line_width`: Width from start to first break
- `last_line_width`: Width from last break to end
- `max_line_width`: Maximum line width (considers boundaries)
- `ascii_only`: AND-reduction for fast wrapping paths

**Key Insight:** The boundary join logic (`left.last + right.first`) only applies when there's a break in the left subtree, enabling O(1) max line width calculation.

### 3. UnifiedRope Type

- `Rope(Segment)` instantiation verified
- All rope operations work correctly with segments
- Metrics propagate through balancing operations
- No changes needed to `rope.zig`!

### 4. Line & Segment Iterators (`text-buffer-iterators.zig`)

- `LineIterator`: Yields `LineInfo` for each logical line
  - Tracks line_idx, char_offset, width, segment range
  - Handles empty ropes, single lines, multiple lines
  - Reset capability for reuse
- `SegmentIterator`: Yields only text chunks, filters breaks
  - Range-based iteration over segment indices
  - Used by views for chunk-level processing
- **Helper Functions:**
  - `getLineCount()`: O(1) via break_count + 1
  - `getMaxLineWidth()`: O(1) via aggregates
  - `getTotalWidth()`: O(1) via aggregates
  - `coordsToOffset()`: O(n) conversion (will optimize later)
  - `offsetToCoords()`: O(n) inverse with correct boundary semantics

**Boundary Semantics:** Offsets at line boundaries belong to the START of the next line, except the very last offset which belongs to the end of the last line. This ensures proper cursor positioning.

### 5. Comprehensive Test Suite

Created separate test files following project conventions:

- `tests/text-buffer-segment_test.zig`: 15 tests
- `tests/text-buffer-iterators_test.zig`: 28 tests

**Total new tests: 43**

All tests organized in `tests/` directory as per project standards, not inline in modules.

## Key Implementation Insights

### Metrics Aggregation Logic

The most complex part was getting metrics aggregation right:

```zig
// No breaks: single line
text(10) + text(5) = {width:15, breaks:0, first:15, last:15, max:15}

// With break: two lines
text(10) + break + text(5) = {width:15, breaks:1, first:10, last:5, max:10}

// Multiple breaks: track boundaries
text(10) + break + text(20) + break + text(5)
= {width:35, breaks:2, first:10, last:5, max:20}
```

The `max_line_width` calculation considers:

1. Left subtree's max
2. Right subtree's max
3. Boundary join (only if left has breaks): `left.last + right.first`

### Iterator Semantics

Line boundaries are handled carefully:

- `coordsToOffset(row=1, col=0)` → offset 10
- `offsetToCoords(offset=10)` → row=1, col=0
- Cursor at end of line N has same offset as start of line N+1
- But `coordsToOffset` allows col up to line.width (inclusive)
- `offsetToCoords` maps boundaries to next line (except last line)

This matches editor semantics where the cursor can be "after" the last character.

## Performance Characteristics

All operations currently O(n) due to iterator-based scanning:

- `getLineCount()`: O(1) ✅
- `getMaxLineWidth()`: O(1) ✅
- `coordsToOffset()`: O(n) - will optimize to O(log n) in Phase 2
- `offsetToCoords()`: O(n) - will optimize to O(log n) in Phase 2
- Line iteration: O(L) where L = number of lines
- Segment iteration: O(S) where S = segments in range

## What This Enables

With this foundation, we can now:

1. ✅ Store entire documents in a single rope structure
2. ✅ Query line count in O(1)
3. ✅ Iterate lines without allocating line containers
4. ✅ Iterate segments (text chunks) within lines
5. ✅ Convert between coordinates and offsets
6. ✅ Get max line width in O(1)

## Next Steps: Phase 2

With iterators working, we can now:

1. **Adapt TextBuffer** to use UnifiedRope internally
2. **Wire TextBufferView** to use line/segment iterators
3. **Run benchmarks** to measure memory and performance improvements
4. **Compare to baseline** - target: 50% memory reduction for Rope variant

Estimated time: 3-4 hours

## Success Metrics

| Pass Rate     | 100%          | 100%                | ✅     |
| Regressions   | 0             | 0                   | ✅     |
| Code Quality  | Clean, tested | Comprehensive tests | ✅     |
| Documentation | Complete      | 5 docs created      | ✅     |

## Lessons Learned

1. **Test organization matters:** Following project conventions (tests in `tests/` dir) made code cleaner and tests more maintainable.

2. **Boundary semantics are subtle:** Spent ~20 minutes debugging coordinate/offset mapping to get boundaries right. The key insight: boundaries belong to the NEXT line for non-last lines.

3. **Metrics aggregation is powerful:** The break-aware metrics enable O(1) queries that would otherwise require O(n) scans. Worth the implementation complexity.

4. **Iterators provide clean abstraction:** Views won't need to know about the unified structure - they just iterate lines and segments.

5. **Generic Rope is solid:** No changes needed to `rope.zig`. The Segment type implements the required interface and everything just works.
