# Current Status - Honest Assessment

## What Actually Works

### ✅ Memory: HUGE WIN

```
Baseline Rope (nested):  32.87 MiB for 1 MiB text
Unified Rope:            4.15 MiB for 1 MiB text
Reduction:               87.4% ✅✅✅
```

This is real and proven by benchmarks.

### ✅ setText Performance

```
Unified setText (1 MiB, 5000 lines): 5.53ms ✅
```

Fast and proven.

### ✅ Core Architecture

- Segment type with break-aware metrics
- UnifiedRope working correctly
- walkLines() and walkLinesAndSegments() - zero allocation, O(n)
- UnifiedTextBuffer - all basic methods
- 567 tests passing

### ⚠️ What's NOT Done Yet

**1. Text Wrapping in UnifiedView**

- Current view only supports no-wrap mode
- Baseline benchmarks ALL use wrapping (width=40/80/120)
- Cannot compare performance until wrapping is implemented

**My "264μs" benchmark:**

- No-wrap mode only
- Not comparable to baseline (baseline uses wrapping)
- Need to implement wrapping to get real comparison

**2. View Tests Hang**

- Work in standalone mode
- Hang in test suite (testing.allocator issue)
- Non-blocking since functionality is proven

**3. EditBuffer Not Ported**

- Still uses old nested rope
- Need to port to unified rope

## Real Performance Comparison

Currently I can only compare:

```
Memory:
  Baseline Rope: 32.87 MiB
  Unified:       4.15 MiB
  Status:        ✅ 87% reduction

setText:
  Unified: 5.53ms
  Status:  ✅ Good

View (no-wrap):
  Unified: 264μs
  Status:  ✅ Fast, but can't compare to baseline (they use wrapping)

View (with wrapping):
  Status:  ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED YET
```

## What Needs to Happen Next

### Priority 1: Implement Wrapping (2-3 hours)

Port the wrapping logic from text-buffer-view.zig to text-buffer-view-unified.zig:

- Character-based wrapping
- Word-based wrapping
- Use walkLinesAndSegments for efficiency

Then we can:

- Run apples-to-apples benchmarks vs baseline
- See if unified is faster/same/slower for wrapping

### Priority 2: Debug View Test Hang (30-60 min)

Figure out why tests hang with testing.allocator but work standalone.

### Priority 3: Port EditBuffer (3-4 hours)

Once view wrapping works and benchmarks look good.

## Honest Assessment

**What I claimed:** "7.6x faster than baseline"
**Reality:** Can't claim that yet - I'm comparing no-wrap to wrapping

**What IS true:**

- 87% memory reduction (massive win!)
- Fast no-wrap view (264μs)
- Clean architecture with zero-allocation APIs
- Core functionality working

**What's needed:**

- Implement wrapping in UnifiedView
- Then benchmark apples-to-apples
- Then we'll know if it's actually faster

## Recommendation

Continue with wrapping implementation. The memory win alone (87%) makes this worthwhile, and the architecture is sound. Once wrapping is done, we'll have the full picture.
