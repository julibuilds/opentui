# Unified Rope Optimization Summary

## Current Status: Massive Memory Win, View Performance Needs Work

### Memory Performance: ✅✅✅ EXCELLENT

```
Baseline Rope:     32.87 MiB (for 1 MiB text)
Unified Rope:      4.15 MiB
Reduction:         87.4% (8x less memory!)
Target was:        50% reduction
Result:            CRUSHED THE TARGET
```

### View Performance: ⚠️ NEEDS OPTIMIZATION

```
Baseline (Rope, no wrap):   ~2ms
UnifiedView (no wrap):      101ms
Slowdown:                   50x
```

## What We've Built

1. **Segment Type** - Text chunks + break markers with break-aware metrics
2. **UnifiedRope** - Single tree for entire document
3. **walkLines() API** - Zero-allocation line iteration using rope.walk()
4. **UnifiedTextBuffer** - setText(), getText(), all core methods
5. **UnifiedTextBufferView** - Basic view (no wrapping yet)

**Tests:** 573/574 passing (+47 from baseline)

## Root Cause Analysis: Why View Is Slow

### The 101ms is spent in:

```zig
updateVirtualLines() {
    // O(n) walk of rope - FAST (uses rope.walk, no allocations)
    walkLines(rope, callback) {
        for each line {
            // Build VirtualLine
            var vline = VirtualLine.init();

            // Walk segments in this line
            for each segment {
                // ALLOCATE virtual chunk
                vline.chunks.append(VirtualChunk{ ... });  // ← Allocation!
            }

            // ALLOCATE virtual line
            self.virtual_lines.append(vline);  // ← Allocation!
            self.cached_line_starts.append(...);  // ← Allocation!
            self.cached_line_widths.append(...);  // ← Allocation!
        }
    }
}
```

With 5000 lines and multiple chunks per line, we're doing **~10,000-20,000 allocations**.

### Why Baseline Is Faster

The baseline rope view uses the SAME arena and doesn't reallocate as much. It also has optimized paths for non-wrapping that we haven't implemented yet.

## Optimization Strategies

### Option 1: Cache Virtual Lines in View (Simplest)

Don't rebuild virtual lines if nothing changed:

```zig
pub fn updateVirtualLines(self: *Self) void {
    if (!self.virtual_lines_dirty and !buffer_dirty) return;  // ← Already have this!

    // Only rebuild if actually dirty
    // ...
}
```

**Issue:** We're ALWAYS dirty on first call, so this doesn't help initial load.

### Option 2: Optimize VirtualChunk Building

For no-wrap mode, we don't need complex VirtualChunk arrays. We can use a simpler representation:

```zig
if (wrap_width == null) {
    // Simple path: just cache line info, no per-chunk overhead
    walkLines(rope, callback) {
        vline.width = line_info.width;
        vline.char_offset = line_info.char_offset;
        // Don't build chunks array for no-wrap!
    }
}
```

### Option 3: Lazy Virtual Line Building

Don't build ALL virtual lines upfront. Build them on-demand:

```zig
pub fn getVirtualLine(self: *Self, idx: u32) VirtualLine {
    // Build just this one line
}
```

**Issue:** View needs all lines for scrolling/rendering, so we'd build them all anyway.

### Recommended: Optimize No-Wrap Path (Quick Win)

The no-wrap case is simple and shouldn't require building VirtualChunk arrays at all. The chunks are accessed directly via SegmentIterator when rendering.

**Current:** Build VirtualChunk array for each line (expensive)
**Optimized:** Just store line info, access chunks on-demand during rendering

**Expected improvement:** 101ms → <5ms for no-wrap

## Performance Targets

| Metric         | Baseline  | Current  | Target  | Strategy           |
| -------------- | --------- | -------- | ------- | ------------------ |
| Memory         | 32.87 MiB | 4.15 MiB | <15 MiB | ✅ DONE            |
| setText        | N/A       | 5.6ms    | <10ms   | ✅ DONE            |
| View (no wrap) | ~2ms      | 101ms    | <5ms    | Option 2           |
| View (wrap)    | ~2-3ms    | TODO     | <5ms    | Implement wrapping |

## Next Steps

### Immediate (30 min):

1. Optimize no-wrap path in UnifiedTextBufferView
2. Benchmark again - expect <5ms

### Short Term (2-3 hours):

3. Implement text wrapping for UnifiedTextBufferView
4. Run full view benchmarks
5. Compare all scenarios to baseline

### Medium Term (3-4 hours):

6. Port EditBuffer to use UnifiedTextBuffer
7. Benchmark edit operations
8. Verify multi-line delete speedup

## Decision Point

**Should we continue?**

**YES** - The memory improvement alone (87% reduction) justifies the migration. The view performance issue is solvable and we're on track to meet all targets.

**Confidence:** High - we've proven the core architecture works, and the remaining optimizations are straightforward.
