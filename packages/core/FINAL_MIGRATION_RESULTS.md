## Test Results

✅ **567/568 tests passing (99.8%)**

- 1 test skipped (intentional)
- 0 test failures
- All EditBuffer tests passing
- All unified text buffer tests passing

| Mixed operations     | 1.66ms   | 3.19ms  | Slower (more insertions)                 |

### Single-line Text Performance

| Scenario  | Baseline (Rope) | Unified | Change            |
| --------- | --------------- | ------- | ----------------- |
| Char @ 80 | 3.75ms          | 98.35μs | **97% faster** ✅ |
| Word @ 80 | 4.24ms          | 2.86ms  | **33% faster** ✅ |

## Architecture Changes

### Files Deleted

- ✅ `text-buffer-nested.zig` - Legacy nested implementation
- ✅ `text-buffer-view-nested.zig` - Legacy nested view
- ✅ `bench/text-buffer-unified_bench.zig` - Separate unified benchmark

### Files Modified

- ✅ `text-buffer-segment.zig` - Now contains all shared types (TextChunk, MemRegistry, etc.)
- ✅ `text-buffer.zig` - Uses types from segment module
- ✅ `text-buffer-view.zig` - Uses types from segment module
- ✅ `text-buffer-iterators.zig` - Uses types from segment module
- ✅ `edit-buffer.zig` - Uses types from segment module
- ✅ `bench/text-buffer-view_bench.zig` - Merged unified benchmarks
- ✅ `bench.zig` - Removed unified bench section
- ✅ `tests/text-buffer-iterators_test.zig` - Uses types from segment module
- ✅ `tests/text-buffer-segment_test.zig` - Uses types from segment module

### Type Organization

All shared types now live in `text-buffer-segment.zig`:

- `TextChunk` - Text segment with lazy grapheme/wrap caching
- `MemRegistry` - Memory buffer registry
- `GraphemeInfo` - Cached grapheme cluster information
- `Highlight` - Styled region on a line
- `StyleSpan` - Pre-computed style span
- `WrapMode` - Character or word wrapping
- `ChunkFitResult` - Chunk fitting result for wrapping
- `Segment` - Union of text chunk or break marker
- `UnifiedRope` - Rope of segments

## Key Improvements

### 1. Memory Efficiency ✅

- **86.3% reduction** in TextBuffer memory (32.87 MiB → 4.49 MiB)
- Single tree structure eliminates double indirection
- No per-line metadata overhead

### 2. Performance Gains ✅

- **25% faster** character wrapping for multi-line text
- **23% faster** word wrapping for multi-line text
- **85% faster** multi-line delete operations
- **97% faster** single-line character wrapping

### 3. Code Simplification ✅

- Single rope traversal instead of nested walks
- Unified coordinate mapping (O(log n) tree descent)
- Simpler edit operations (single rope manipulation)
- Removed ~1,900 lines of legacy code

### 4. Feature Parity ✅

- Full highlight system with per-line spans
- Text selection with grapheme-based extraction
- Both character and word wrapping modes
- SIMD-optimized line break detection
- View dirty tracking for multiple views
- EditBuffer with cursor-based editing

## Migration Notes

### What Was Kept

- All test coverage (567/568 tests still passing)
- Full API compatibility through re-exports
- EditBuffer functionality with unified backend
- View wrapping with same quality
- Highlight and selection systems

### What Was Removed

- Nested rope implementation (TextBufferRope)
- Array-based nested implementation (TextBufferArray)
- Legacy view implementations
- Double-indirection tree traversals
- Per-line metadata structures

### Performance Trade-offs

- Small single insertions are slightly slower (more rope operations)
- Multi-line operations are much faster (single tree update)
- Overall memory usage dramatically reduced
- View wrapping performance improved across the board

## Success Criteria - All Met ✅

- ✅ Rope TB memory < 15 MiB (achieved 4.49 MiB, 86% reduction)
- ✅ View wrap times within 90-110% of baseline (23-25% faster!)
- ✅ Multi-line delete improves by >30% (achieved 85% improvement)
- ✅ All tests pass (567/568 passing, 1 intentionally skipped)
- ✅ Code simplicity improved (EditBuffer multi-line ops much simpler)
- ✅ Nested implementation completely removed

## Conclusion

The unified rope migration is **complete and successful**. The legacy nested implementation has been entirely removed from the codebase. The unified architecture delivers:

1. **Massive memory savings** (86% reduction)
2. **Performance improvements** across most operations
3. **Simpler codebase** with single rope structure
4. **Feature parity** with all original functionality
5. **No breaking changes** for external consumers

The unified rope is now the **only implementation** and is production-ready.
